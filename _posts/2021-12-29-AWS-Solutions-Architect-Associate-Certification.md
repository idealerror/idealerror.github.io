I wanted to put together a great archive of resources that I used to pass the SA Associate certification for AWS.  With these resources, I was able to study for a couple hours per day in just a few weeks and pass the exam.

After finishing some of the trainings, I went straight into the practice exams/study guides.  Below are some of the resources I used.

# Training/Labs
## [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com/) - Not Free
I had a great experience going through the A Cloud Guru training as a refresher for some things I did not know already.  The classes are easy to follow and the labs are quick. The interface is very friendly to use

## [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - Not Free
If you're already used to Udemy, there are a TON of great classes on Udemy that can help you pass the SAA exam.  I had originally watched the A Cloud Guru class on Udemy years ago prior to using their website.

## [AWS Skill Builder](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn) - Free/Paid
AWS Skill Builder has a ton of great training resources you can go through to cover a majority of the topics you need to know.

## [Amazon AWS Training](https://www.amazon.com/aws-courses/) - Free
These are the new courses offered on Amazon.com.

# Practice Exams
## [TutorialsDojo](https://www.tutorialsdojo.com/) - Some Free Tests
Great practice exams!

## [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com/) - Not Free
I found the practice test very helpful, but I think I got more value out of the TutorialsDojo practice exams.

## [Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/) - Some Free Tests
Great practice exams!

# Study Guides
## [keenanromain SAA Study Guide on GitHub](https://github.com/keenanromain/AWS-SAA-C02-Study-Guide) - Free
I found this guide extremely helpful.  I reviewed it multiple times to make sure I was able to dot my I's and cross my T's.  I highly recommend this Study Guide.

## [SA Associate Cheat Sheet](https://zigzag-geography-ea3.notion.site/AWS-Architect-Associate-f02aa54b0bd345ada0cc0f1e49e3a99b) - Free
These are the slides from this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia-UEYYR44s).  This was very helpful as a quick refresher

# In Summary

Find what works for you.  These are the resources I used and overall I only found myself not able to answer 1 or 2 questions on the exam.  The rest of the questions I had covered based on the training/guides I listed above (and working knowledge).
